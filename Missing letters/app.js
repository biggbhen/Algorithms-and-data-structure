// Code Explanation
// This solutions makes use of a for loop.
// Code of encountered character is stored in code.
// It is checked if code of current character is the expected one (no characters are skipped) by using the logic - code of current character = code of first character + number of iterations.
// If a character is missing, the missing character is found and the final string is returned.
// undefined is returned if there is no missing character in the string.
